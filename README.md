# Advanced Tumor Recognition and Prediction in Medical Imaging

-----

üéØ **Overview**

This project introduces a sophisticated deep learning system for **detecting and classifying tumor types in Medical Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans**. Our model utilizes a powerful **VGG19-ResNet50 hybrid architecture** to accurately identify benign and malignant tumors, with a primary focus on lung and breast cancers.

‚ú® **Key Features**

  * **Domain-Specific Excellence**: Built upon advanced Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and deep learning models, our system is meticulously tuned for precise medical image analysis.
  * **Hybrid Architecture**: We've combined the robust feature extraction capabilities of **VGG19** with the deep residual learning of **ResNet50**. This fusion enables enhanced pattern recognition and superior classification performance.
  * **Multi-Scale Feature Extraction**: The architecture integrates multiple convolutional layers with varying kernel sizes, allowing the capture of diverse patterns and details at different scales within MRI scans.
  * **Production-Ready Pipeline**: The system includes a comprehensive training pipeline, complete with evaluation metrics and visualization tools, making it ready for real-world application.

üìä **Dataset**

The model is rigorously trained on a diverse collection of **Lung, Breast, and Brain Tumor datasets**, comprising:

  * MRI scans from a variety of patients' breasts, lungs, and brains.
  * **Multi-class labels** for lung and breast cancer data (distinguishing between benign, malignant, and normal cases).
  * **Binary labels** for brain tumor data (indicating the presence or absence of a tumor).

**Data Split**:

To ensure robust training and evaluation, the dataset is strategically split as follows:

  * **Training**: 80%
  * **Test**: 10%
  * **Validation**: 10%
