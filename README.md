# Advanced Tumor Recognition and Prediction in Medical Imaging

A sophisticated deep learning system for detecting tumor types in IRMs using a VGG19-ResNet50 Architecture.

## ðŸŽ¯Overview
This project implements a state-of-the-art tumor detection system designed for IRM scans of lung and breast tumors. The model combines the power of a pre-trained very large CNN (VGG19) and a Deep Residual-Learning framework (ResNet50) to achieve high accuracy in identifying benign, malignant tumor types.
